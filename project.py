# 1. Create a set of location names using a location count
# 2. Create a set of locations that are the locations for the TAs
# 3. Create a starting point
# 4. Create a graph
#     a. we need to ensure connectedness
#         i. we need to make sure that there is a spanning tree and then we can add to it as necessary as necessary
#     b. we need to ensure triangle inequality is satisfied
#         ii. we need to find the shortest paths from each vertex to all other vertices
#             1) If there is an edge from that vertex to the other vertex, we check if it satisfies the triangle inequality with the shortest path using Floyd Warshall
